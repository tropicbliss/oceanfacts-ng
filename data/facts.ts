Without the ink sac, most cephalopods would be much more vulnerable to sharks, whales, and large fish that try to eat them. But, there are few large predators in the depths of the ocean. Part of this is due to the fact that there is very little prey at extreme depths. So, without many sharks, whales, or large fish, the dumbo octopus would rarely (if ever) be required to use an ink sac to escape from predators. Since the ink sac costs energy to grow, maintain, and fill with ink, it would be a complete waste for the dumbo octopus to keep its ink sac.

Unlike human-made bulletproof vests, however, those aren't fused together with a third adhesive layer—the two layers of each arapaima scale actually grow together. This makes it ideal for pressure absorption and range of motion, which researchers hope can help inform advances in materials science.",

The study found that the cormorants were consuming 1.3 million bass per year. Most of this 1.3 million were smallmouth that were three to five years old. Centuries ago the Chinese figured out that they could use cormorants for fishing. They would capture a cormorant, tie a long string around one of its legs and place a collar around the bird's throat. They would then go out in a boat, hold the string while the bird dove down and swallowed a fish. They would then pull the bird back to the boat and squeeze the neck above the collar and plop the fish into",

They can cover thousands of square miles and, thanks to the colorful accounts of 19th-century mariners like Capt. Kingman, milky seas are a well-known part of maritime folklore. But because of their remote and elusive nature, they are extremely difficult to study and so remain more a part of that folklore than of science. Unlike bioluminescence that happens close to shore, where small organisms called dinoflagellates flash brilliantly when disturbed, luminous bacteria work in an entirely different way. Once their population gets large enough – about 100 million individual cells per milliliter of water – a sort of internal biological switch is flipped and they all start glowing steadily. Now imagine if a gargantuan number of bacteria, spread across a huge area of open ocean, all started glowing simultaneously. That makes a milky sea. Researchers think the purpose of this glow could be to attract fish that eat them. These bacteria thrive in the guts of fishes, so when their populations get too big for their main food supply, a fish's stomach makes a great second option.",

      "Soft-shell crabs are what we get after stone crabs go through their molting stage and shed their hard shells. The process typically takes two to three hours. It's extremely difficult to determine how old a stone crab is. So, its age is determined by how many times it has molted. It's estimated that, in wild and unharvested populations, males live between 7 and 8 years while females live between 8 and 9 years. Stone crabs are generally right-handed – The right hand is often bigger than the left and stronger. The animal has powerful claws either way. The limb is capable of crushing 19,000 pounds per square inch.",

The noise appeared once a year and was so loud they planned to sue the electricity company. In fact, it was made by the male toadfish vibrating a muscle on his swimbladder to attract the female with a noise similar to a foghorn. The female swims towards the male and when he grabs her in his jaws they retreat to a suitable crevice to spawn in private. Residents of the bay now celebrate this event with an annual festival.",

Bodies tend to sink in colder water, and the skin absorbs water and peels away from the corpse within a week, slowly being eaten away by marine life. Bodies can stay recognizable for months. In tropical water, it’s a different story. Even a weighted body will normally float to the surface after three or four days, exposing it to sea birds and buffeting from the waves. Putrefaction and scavenging creatures will dismember the corpse in a week or two and the bones will sink to the seabed.",

The Octavius was one of many to meet such a fate, but the grim scenes found on board was what made the story of this ghost ship particularly terrifying. The three-masted schooner departed from England in 1761, but was found off the coast of Greenland in 1775. Her captain had, unluckily decided to try and use the then nonexistent Northwest Passage (which superyacht Rosehearty has since cleared) to return home. The five men who boarded the derelict ship in 1775 were confronted with a ghostly sight; the entire 28-man crew was below deck, but frozen to death. The icy figure of the ship's captain was discovered sitting at his desk, writing in his logbook, pen still in hand.

Early research suggested that crocodile icefish blood lacks red blood cells and hemoglobin as they had already absorbed enough oxygen from the extremely low-temperature but oxygen-rich waters of their surroundings. It was thought that this adaptation made their blood thinner which helped the blood in their bodies to circulate faster. This also aided in adapting to an extreme environment. However, new developments in science have revealed that the lack of hemoglobin and red blood cells might be accidental, as the absence of the protein hemoglobin along with red blood cells has reduced the oxygen-carrying capability of their blood.",

When Mary surrendered to the attacking pirates and subsequently joined the crew, Anne couldn't help but notice this bold and handsome new recruit. Though accounts vary, according to Captain Charles Johnson, Anne Bonny was initially drawn to Mary Read by physical attraction. Anne sought Mary out romantically, believing her to be an especially beautiful man. Once Anne's intentions became obvious, though, Mary decided to reveal her true identity. Anne was either disappointed or intrigued by this revelation depending on which accounts you believe. Some historians argue that Anne and Mary were lovers, others that they were just friends. Captain Charles, for one, seems to have believed that the two were lovers. Both Mary and Anne had reputations as the toughest of the tough in the pirate world- they could fight, swear, steal, and even kill with the best of them. They were known as some of the fiercest fighters on Calico Jack's crew, certainly challenging the old pirate saying that having women aboard a ship invites bad luck. Mary was known to pick fights with crewmembers \"when she had been insulted,\" and Anne is rumored to have brutally stabbed a man in the heart for making comments about women on board ships bringing bad luck to sailors. Anne was listed as a \"Most Wanted\" pirate in a Boston newspaper, an example of both her fierceness and her renown. The two women are often depicted in battle together, dressed in men's clothes and carrying pistols, cutlasses, and knives Near midnight on October 22, Anne and Mary were on deck when they noticed a mysterious sloop gliding up alongside them. They realized it was one of the governor's vessels, The sloop's captain, Jonathan Barnett, ordered the pirates to surrender, but Rackam began firing his swivel gun. Barnett ordered a counterattack, and the barrage of fire disabled Rackam's ship and sent the few men on deck to cowering in the hold. Outnumbered, Rackam signaled surrender and called for quarter.But Anne and Mary refused to surrender. They remained on deck and faced the governor's men alone, firing their pistols and swinging their cutlasses. Mary, the legend goes, was so disgusted she stopped fighting long enough to peer over the entrance of the hold and yell, \"If there's a man among ye, ye'll come up and fight like the man ye are to be!\" When not a single comrade responded, she fired a shot down into the hold, killing one of them. Anne, Mary and the rest of Rackam's crew were finally overpowered and taken prisoner. Anne and Mary were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged, but their executions were stayed—because, as lady luck would have it, they were both \"quick with child.\"",

      "A fish called the Pacific lingcod has one of nature's toothiest mouths, with about 555 teeth lining its two sets of jaws. Now, a new study suggests that these fish lose teeth as fast as they grow them — at an astonishing rate of 20 per day. To understand how the Pacific lingcod's mouth looks and functions, first throw out almost everything you know about your own mouth. Instead of incisors, molars and canines, these fish have hundreds of sharp, near-microscopic teeth on their jaws. Their hard palate is also covered in hundreds of tiny dental stalactites. And behind one set of jaws lies another set of accessory jaws, called pharyngeal jaws, that the fish use to chew food much in the same way humans use molars. Because the Pacific lingcod's teeth are so small, figuring out how quickly these fish lose their teeth was not as simple as sweeping them from the aquarium floor. Instead, the researchers placed the lingcod in a tank filled with a dilute red dye, which stained the fish's teeth red. Later, the researchers moved the fish to a tank filled with a fluorescent green dye, which stained the teeth again. In total, they counted over 10,000 teeth across all 20 captive fish. They also found that the fish lose an average of roughly 20 teeth per day.",

Before the vernal pool dries up again, the females produce hardy resting eggs, called cysts, which survive the dry season and hatch when the rains come again. This strategy allows them to avoid predators that can't survive in such a temporary habitat.

Only oceanic neuston, organisms that float or swim just below the ocean surface, have historically been found near these patches, as they thrive in open ocean.

But when conditions are bad, such as lack of food or water, the female brine shrimp release eggs that have a covering around them called a cyst. These cysts protect the baby brine shrimp inside. The babies will stay inside the cysts until the conditions improve. They can stay in the cysts for a long, long time and can still hatch later on when there is enough water and food to keep them alive. Because brine shrimp can do this, von Braunhut realized that he could put brine shrimp eggs into packages and sell them in stores. The brine shrimp eggs in the package would be in a state of cryptobiosis in their cysts until someone bought them, put them into water, and began to feed them. He thought kids would be fascinated by the creatures, but brine shrimp wasn't a very attractive name. Because they have long tails like monkeys, he decided to name them sea monkeys.",

How do they do this? Their primary diet is sea algae. When they consume it, they suck the chloroplasts out of the algae in a process called kleptoplasty. This process then enables them to photosynthesize. This is why leaf slugs glow, In other words, they are bioluminescent.",

      "Over the years there have been numerous theories concerning the leaping of mullet. There seems to be two categories of leaping: predator avoidance and aerial respiration. Leaping to avoid predators usually involves more than one fish jumping simultaneously, retaining an upright posture and entering the water cleanly. The second type of leaping involves a single fish that does a slower, shorter leap, often flipping onto its side or even onto its back. They may also roll at the surface or move with their head above the water. The research of Hoese (1985) suggests that Sea Mullet use this second category of movements to fill the pharyngobranchial organ (an area at the back of the throat) with air. The trapped air is believed to allow the fish to remain active in water of low oxygen concentration for about five minutes. Several interesting lines of evidence support this theory. The number of jumps is correlated with the concentration of oxygen in the water. The less oxygen, the more jumps. Secondly, Sea Mullet feed during the day often in bottom sediments that have low oxygen concentrations. Jumping occurs much more commonly during the day. Sea Mullet rarely jump at night.",

These type of eyes are very good at collecting any little bit of light that may be finding its way to the deep ocean depths. The eyes of the barreleye fish generally look up so they are able to detect slight movements in their prey directly above them. For awhile, scientists believed that the eyes could only look up but recent studies have indicated that the barreleye fish is able to direct their unique eyes forward to see what they are eating.

Growing to around 20 inches long, they are one of the largest of the 10 species that comprise the beardfish family, Polymixiidae, which is a group of fishes closely related to alfonsinos and other deepwater red-colored fishes in the family Berycidae. The Pacific beardfish lives on muddy and sandy bottoms in waters up to 1,800 feet deep throughout the Indo-Pacific region, from east Africa to the Hawaiian Islands, north to Japan, and as far south as Australia. The scientific name Polymixia is derived from the Greek words poly (a lot of) and myxos (mucus), suggesting they are slimy little fish. Their common name, "beardfish," is of course due to the presence of the two prominent sensory barbels under the chin, which they use to "taste" for smaller fish and crustaceans as they swim over the sediments.',

Males in their terminal color phase are brightly-colored while females are green with black lines. The most brilliantly-colored male Christmas wrasses have reddish-pink background coloration on their body with ladder-like stripes that are bright blue and green in color. In its initial phase, a male has a diagonal dark red line below its eye. The head of the male is brown, orange or shaded with blue, while the head of females is spotted. Younger animals of both sexes are a more drab green and brown color. The Christmas wrasse's ability to change colors and sex has caused confusion over the years over species identification.

      "The Newport Beach Christmas Parade is a magical event that happens each year with boats/yachts traveling down a route while decorated in fantastic lights. But how did this event come to be? In 1907, John Scarpa began a tradition by lighting boats decorated in Japanese lanterns and taking visitors around the bay. However, a year later on July 4th this would be expanded and turned into what is credited as the first lighted boat parade. This would eventually be known as the Tournament of lights in the early days with thousands of visitors and historians participating in a contest to see which boat was decorated better. Unfortunately this is the 1900s so in 1914 the event was put on pause because of something called world War 1. In 1919 Joseph Beek continued the event was back on and excluding a couple years for world war 2, the tournament of lights was held every year until 1949 because the old people were wary of the spectacle attracting so much foot traffic near the harbor. \"But Disco this doesn't sound Christmas at all still, it's celebrated on July 4th you idiot\" You might think and to that I say screw you buddy because in 1946 a separate group of people started attaching a Christmas tree to a decorated boat to float around on christmas and in later years Joseph Beek and his family were in charge of using their boats for the tree. Gradually more boats also decorated in lights would follow Joseph Beek's boat and the tradition would be come to be known as the Newport Beach Christmas Parade that features over 100+ vessels each year in Southern California, completely free to the public",

Large food falls, like a whale carcass provides a huge pulse of food in an environment that tends to be food limited. The carcasses attract scavengers like sharks, hagfish, crabs, and smaller crustaceans such as amphipods who quickly consume the flesh. The exposed bones are then available to Osedax worms and bone-eating snails that digest the minerals and with the help of free-living and symbiotic microbes and consume the remaining organic compounds.

Counter current exchange is the mechanism in which oxygen enters the blood in fish. Blood flows in the opposite direction to the water that flows over the fish's gills. Fish gills have gill filaments and these filaments have protrusions called lamellae which the water flows over. The lamellae increase the surface area of the gills meaning that there is a larger area for the oxygen to diffuse over. With the counter current exchange system the water is always richer in oxygen than in the blood therefore maintaining the concentration gradient. The oxygen then diffuses into the blood capillaries of the fish.",

It was first discovered in the early 19th century by Mary Anning in England. The name for the marine reptiles group, ichthyosaurs, was first put to use by Charles Konig in 1818. Almost all fossil ichthyosaurs during the 19th century were attributed to the Ichthyosaurus marine reptile, due to which the genus had 50 species by 1900. These species were subsequently moved to separate genera and used interchangeably with other species. They were built for speed and paddled with their tails, fins, and short fingers. They were predators from the Ichthyosauria group animals that breathed air without gills.",

Searching for mates can be difficult and risky since seahorses are poor swimmers, found in low densities and rely on camouflage to hide from predators. By remaining faithful to one partner, the pairs have more time to undergo more pregnancies during a single mating season and, ultimately, have greater reproductive success. The pair-bonds of monogamous seahorses are reinforced by daily greetings.",

      "Scallops have up to 200 eyes, and each of them uses a mirror instead of a lens to focus light. Biologists have known since the 1960s that these concave mirrors are made from crystals of guanine, a highly reflective material that can be seen in everything from fish scales to chameleon skin. Although these crystals usually form into bulky prisms, the crystals in the scallop's eye are perfect squares that—like a telescope mirror—create a smooth surface that minimizes optical distortions. Now, scientists have shown just how these mirrors work. Using computer simulations, they found that when light comes in straight, it hits the upper of the scallop's two retinas. But when light comes in at an angle, it hits the lower retina, enhancing the scallop's peripheral vision in dim light, they report today in Science. They also hypothesize just how these creatures make sense of images from 200 different eyes at once: a process in the scallop's \"brain\" that combines them all into a single, cohesive image.",

Individual scup spawn once a year, with females releasing an average of 7,000 eggs, which are fertilized externally. Their eggs and larvae are found in the water column in coastal waters during warmer months. As larvae mature, they settle to the seafloor and develop into juveniles. Scup migrate north and inshore to spawn in the spring, then migrate south and offshore in autumn as the water cools, arriving by December in offshore areas where they spend the winter.",

The scientists published their findings in the journal Biology Letters. In some species of fish, smaller, less flashy males can win over females by flirting with larger males. Researchers worked with the tropical freshwater fish Poecilia mexicana. After witnessing this behavior, the female fish indicated their newly awakened interest by spending more time swimming near the images of the less impressive males. The finding suggests that homosexual behavior can enhance a male's ability to pass on his genes by attracting females that wouldn't be interested in him otherwise. Mollies aren't the only fish that exhibit homosexual behavior. There are documented cases of at least 15 different species doing the same. Whether all of these species do so in an effort to attract more females hasn't yet been determined.",

A timber circle with an upturned tree root in the centre, Seahenge, along with the nearby timber circle Holme II, was built in the spring-summer of 2049 BCE, during the early Bronze Age in Britain. Contemporary theory is that they were used for ritual purposes. In order to preserve the timber in the site from exposure to air, due to recent exposure of the remains by the sea, it was excavated in Spring 1999, and its remains taken to an archeological museum and then a maritime museum for preservation of the wood. In 1999, a reproduction was put up by some of the excavators, near the site. In 2008, after further study, a second reproduction was erected near the original's location.

To paralyze their victims, box jellyfish use venom. This venom is released into the prey as soon as the prey triggers one of the jellyfishes stinging cells (nematocysts). When the stinging cell is activated, a harpoon-like coil is released, which stings the prey, and the jellyfish venom then flows through the prey via the harpoon. The tentacle will then retract back into the jellyfish, dragging the prey in.",

      "A Mongolian legend tells of a giant Taimen trapped in river ice. Starving herders were able to survive the winter by hacking off pieces of its flesh. In the spring, the ice melted, and the giant Taimen climbed onto the land, tracked down the herders, and ate them all.",

      "Tiger barbs have a strong need to be in large groups. They are highly social and will only thrive when kept in groups of eight or more. A school of tiger barb fish will develop a pecking order, similar to a pack of wolves or a pod of dolphins. If you learn to discern the differences between your tiger barbs, you will see that they eat in the exact same order every time.",

      "Rohu is a pure vegetarian fish; however, their food preference changes with the change in their age. The diet of rohu fry consists mainly of zooplankton, whereas rohu adults feed on phytoplankton and submerged plants. They also like to feed on bread, which is hence used as bait to catch them on a hook. In their organic environment, this fish mainly feeds by sieving the water with the help of their thin hair-like gill rakers. Since they do not have any teeth in their jaw, the fish feeds by nibbling the food using their mouth.",

      'Cisco are sometimes called the "canaries of cold water." They do not tolerate warm water or low oxygen levels and have declined in, or disappeared from, over 20 percent of their native lakes in Michigan. Development and other land use changes can lead to increases in the nutrient phosphorus. Increased nutrient levels accelerate plant and algae growth, which in turn drives greater decomposition below the thermocline of stratified lakes, depleting oxygen required for cisco to thrive. Inland lakes that do retain high water quality are often stocked with trout, which also require cold oxygenated water, or other gamefish. Stocking predators or competitors is also recognized as the cause of cisco decline in some inland lakes.',

      "The Asian Swamp Eel, was introduced by unknown sources to ponds at the Chattahoochee Nature Center (CNC) in the mid-1990's. The eels at the CNC are one of only five populations found in the United States, the others being in Hawaii and in Florida. It is possible that they were introduced when someone dumped a fish tank. Another possibility is someone intentionally introduced them in an attempt to establish a food source. As with any invasive species, the eels present a threat to native species by disrupting their interactions with their natural habitat. Beyond not being a part of the natural ecosystem, they have several traits that make it a bigger threat. They breathe air, and are capable of withstanding harsh environmental conditions. During periods of drought, they burrow into the ground. They are able to colonize unconnected bodies of water via overland migration. Because they are active at night, they are difficult to detect and capture. They are also tolerant of cool water, such as that of the Chattahoochee River.",

      "It is entirely possible to use hot dogs as bait instead of the normal options of night crawlers, crickets, etc. Now it is not likely the fish will eat the hotdog but all you really need is enough time for your catch to get caught on the hook. This method is especially effective on catfish, carp, northern pike, and bluegill because they're all opportunistic feeders. If you are going to use hotdog as bait it should go without saying using the the entire hotdog per cast is incredibly wasteful and it's better to rip off small chunks as fish aren't picky about hotdog serving sizes.",
